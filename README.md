# Trust Bank

**Trust Bank** is made up of a network of users who have access to feature phones. An Android app allows individuals to act as brokers between people without access to bank accounts or smartphones. The application allows brokers to automatically facilitate blockchain transactions when it receives a request to send money from a user's cellphone number via the xDai network. Wallets can be manually funded in the app by the brokers and users can withdraw their funds to a self managed wallet at any time.

# Further Development
All transactions on the network were designed to work as multisig transactions, although for the hackathon this was disabled. Brokers are currently not rewarded for acting as facilitators in the network, this can be remedied by introducing service fees for participants. 

# The Tech
We used Flutter to build the mobile app. We built the smart contract (which can be found at the link below) for xDai.

The tooling we used did not allow us to complete our project successfully so we pivoted to Ether.
